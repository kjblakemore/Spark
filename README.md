# Spark Projects

This repository includes projects from two Spark EdX courses:
* <i>CS100.1x Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark</i>
* <i>CS190.1x Scalable Machine Learning</i>

Both courses were taught during the summer of 2015 by Anthony Joseph and Ameet Talwalker, from the University of Califonia, Berkeley.

The projects involve descriptive and predictive analysis of data sets using Spark RDDs.
